# Additions List

## Potential improvements and features you could add to your Conway's Game of Life implementation:

### Optimization [X]
* Sparse Representation: Storing only the live cells in a set.
* Avoid Redundant Drawing: Only redraw the changed cells instead of the entire grid.

### User Interface Enhancements [ ]:
* Zoom In/Out: Allow the user to zoom in or out, especially if the grid size is large.
* Drag and Move: Implement a feature to move around the grid.
* Predefined Patterns: Allow the user to select and place predefined patterns (like gliders or spaceships).
* Adjust Simulation Speed: Add a slider or buttons to speed up, slow down, or step through the simulation one frame at a time.

### Advanced Features [ ]
* Save and Load: Allow users to save their current pattern and load it later.
* Boundary Conditions: Add options for different boundary conditions, like wrapping around the edges (toroidal array) to create a continuous world.
* Color: Introduce more colors. Could color recently born cells with a different shade, giving a visual indication of changes.
* Statistics: Display the number of living cells, the generation number, etc.
* Rule Variations: The classic Game of Life is just one rule-set of cellular automata. Allow users to define their own rules.

### Code Refinement [ ]
* Modularization: UI operations, grid handling, and simulation logic into separate classes or modules.
* Documentation: Add inline comments and perhaps a user guide.
* Error Handling: Add more comprehensive error handling for user inputs or file operations.

### Expand Beyond 2D [ ]
* 3D version of Conway's Game of Life.

### Testing [ ]
* Adding unit tests for core functionalities.
